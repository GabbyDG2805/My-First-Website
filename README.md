# My-First-Website
The first website I ever made as part of the Web Authoring Module in first year Computer Science. The task was to select a band for which to design and create a mock responsive website for and convey their image. This assignment introduced the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as a website, designs such as moodboards and wireframes were created, and a report was written detailing how best practice and standards were identified, appraised and applied throughout the siteâ€™s development.
